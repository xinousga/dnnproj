Moreover, it was not required to use the security filter in this case because only authorized users can create or edit a product.

- Fixed a bug introduced in SqlDataProvider file of the version 02.01.27 concerning DotNetNuke instances using a database owner other than dbo only.

- Ressources Previous.Text (<<) and Next.Text (>>) from the file ProductList.ascx.resx have been replaced by &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to be fully XHTML compliant.

Enhancements:

- Products: During the deletion of a product, if the product is not related to an order it is now really deleted.

- Categories: During the deletion of a category, if it does not contains sub-categories or products it is now really deleted. If the category is linked to sub-categories or products marked "deleted" (IsDeleted=1), then the category is marked "deleted".

- Three new settings were added to the Category Products section of the Store Catalog module. With the settings "Sort By" and "Direction", the section can be sorted now by: Manufacturer, Model Number, Unit Price or Date (ascending or descending for direction). Previously this was hard coded by ModelName ascending. The third setting "Sub-Categories" when unchecked allow to do not include the sub-categories of the selected category in the product's list. By default, this setting is checked for maintain compatibility behavior with previous versions.

- Address provider: Now the user address account is proposed at checkout and the user can select a previously entered address. In addition, users can manage their addresses (add, modify, delete) using the Store Account module and the user's full name field was splited in two fields (First Name and Last Name).

- Many enhancements inside the templating system for XHTML compliancy. All css files has been rewritten and classes renamed. Each token rendered as text is now enclosed by a span with a specific css class. This allow a better control to change the look of the Store.

- Added support of transparent GIF and TIFF format for product image (STO-2437).

To workaround this limitation, a new setting has been added to the modules Store Catalog, Store MiniCart and Store Account. The 'GIF Background' setting allow you to define the color to use as background for GIF images with transparency.

- Display Category Description on mouse-over category link (STO-2529).

- Previously, the checkout was a desktop module called as an "Edit" control, in this mode all other modules are hidden and the Admin skin is applied. Now, the checkout process is done inside the Store Account control.

- To avoid multiple indexing by the DNN Search Engine when using several Store Catalog modules, a new setting 'Enable Content Indexing' has been added to the Store Catalog settings. If you use several Store Catalog modules inside your portal, please verify than ONLY ONE module have content indexed.

- Added a verification related to the localized graphic buttons. If the current local version is not found, the default en-US is used instead. This mimics the default behavior of DotNetNuke resources and avoids the red cross displayed when the corresponding image file is not found.

- Automatic synchronization of the file system was added when the administrator enables the portal templates.

- At checkout, the link button "Add or Edit Address" has been splited in two link buttons (Add and Modify). When a link is clicked, the user is redirected to the Address form to create/modify address. If the registration address is selected, then user is redirected to the DotNetNuke User Profile. This are just shortcuts but should help for a better navigation. A validation of the selected address (billing and shipping) has been added to avoid empty or incomplete address.

- A message is now displayed when a category do not contains product or when a search do not return product. Previously the catalog was simply hidden, this should provide a better user experience. In addition, other list of products (New, Popular, Featured) are no longer hidden when the visitor navigates between catalog pages.

A new "Keywords" field was added to the category form and to the product form. The title can be personalized with the resource ListSEOTitle.Text inside Catalog.ascx.resx. This resource use three new tokens: [CATEGORYNAME], [PAGETITLE] and [STORETITLE]. Then, if the category name is "Softwares", page title is "Catalog" and store title is "On-line Store", the injected title can be "Softwares Catalog at On-line Store" using the resource value: [CATEGORYNAME] [PAGETITLE] at [STORETITLE]. Similarly, it is possible to control META tags Description and Keywords. You can use the resource ListSEOKeywords.Text with the tokens [CATEGORYKEYWORDS] [STOREKEYWORDS] and [PAGEKEYWORDS] to control the Keywords META tag. The resource ListSEODescription.Text use the tokens [CATEGORYDESCRIPTION] [STOREDESCRIPTION] and [PAGEDESCRIPTION] to control the META tag Description. As for product's list, the product detail page title can be personalized with the resource DetailsSEOTitle.Text inside ProductDetail.ascx.resx. The following tokens can be used to build the page title: [PAGETITLE], [STORETITLE], [MANUFACTURER], [MODELNUMBER], [MODELNAME], [PRODUCTTITLE]. Using the resource value: [MANUFACTURER] - [MODELNAME] ([MODELNUMBER]) at [STORETITLE], the resulting page title will be something like that: "Wrox - Professional DotNetNuke 4 (0-471-78816-3) at On-Line Store".

- A settings section where added inside the Mini Cart module settings. This section contains four new settings: Show Thumbnail, Thumbnail Width, Product Column and Include VAT. Previously, it was not posible to choose witch product column to display (Model Number, Model Name, Product Title) as product name without altering the MiniCart.ascx control. Because it's a real problem for future upgrade, now you are able to define the product column to display in the settings section. Moreover, you can choose to display the product thumbnail and it's width. The last setting (Include VAT) allow to display the product's price with VAT included in the Mini Cart.

- A link to return to the Store page has been added to the Store Account module.

- Two new settings and a hard coded rule was added to the Store Admin module. Previously, only members of the Administrators group and host accounts was able to manage the Store settings and status order. Now the Store Info tab (Store settings) will be displayed only to admin and host accounts. The new settings "Manage Orders" and "Manage Catalog" allow to define which user's group can edit status order and/or can manage the catalog (Categories, Products and Reviews).

- When an order is edited by an authorized user, the client's email address is displayed below his billing address. This is another usefull shortcut if you have to contact your client.

- Two new tokens ([SEARCH] and [SEARCHRESULTS]) have been added and may be used in the Catalog.htm template. The [SEARCH] token render several controls (Labels, TextBox, DropDownList and a LinkButton) to allow the visitor to search in the catalog. While the [SEARCHRESULTS] token displays the search results in place of the catalog product list. Three new settings have been added to the Store Catalog settings to define the search column list, the default search column and the template to use to render the results.

- The status order management have been changed, administrators and authorized users can add a comment to the confirmation email sent to the customer and they can disable the email.

- Some caching methods have been added to retrieve settings more quickly and two new settings have been added to the Store Catalog module to enable/disable image caching and to set image cache duration. Given than the catalog is built entirely dynamically, previously, parameters were read several times during the display of each section (Category, New, Featured, ...). Similarly, each product images were resized several times if they appears several times on the page. This should further improve performance.
